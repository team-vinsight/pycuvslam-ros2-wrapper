# Parameters for Orbbec Gemini 2L
# WARNING: The intrinsics (fx, fy, cx, cy) below are PLACEHOLDERS.
# You MUST update them with the actual calibration values of your camera.
# You can usually obtain these from the camera SDK or by running a calibration,
# or by checking the /camera/color/camera_info topic.

  # Approximation for Gemini 2L (Wide FOV)
  # These are roughly scaled from a typical wide angle, but specific to your unit.
  fx: 600.0    # Approximate
  fy: 600.0    # Approximate
  cx: 640.0    # Approximate center
  cy: 400.0    # Approximate center
  
  # Distortion model: 0=Pinhole, 1=Fisheye, 2=Brown, 3=Polynomial
  # Orbbec images are often rectified (undistorted) if D2C is enabled or if using on-chip processing.
  # If using 'raw' images, you might have distortion.
  # Assuming rectified images here (Pinhole, 0 distortion).
